### Project: CodeContact

CodeContact is a desktop address book solution for Software Engineering companies. The user interacts with it using a
CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Find
    * What it does: Project managers can find for developers, clients and projects based on the specified attributes.
    * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly as project managers might want to look out for
        certain attributes in a developer before adding them to a new project, or sort clients based on their 
        organisation or even group projects according to their deadline.
    * Highlights: This implementation was challenging as it required creating new predicates for each of the attributes
        of the developers, clients and projects. The feature also allows for multi-level searching as project managers
        can find based on multiple attributes at the same time. This allows for even more detailed searching. The find
        feature then displayed the updated filtered list on the GUI. In addition, the find implementation was utilisede
    in the implementation of the delete feature as well.

* **Enhancements to existing features**:
    * Wrote additional tests for existing features to increase coverage.

### Find Feature

#### Implementation

The find feature is facilitated by a map-based strategy, associating specific prefixes (e.g., "find-developer n/" or "
find-client r/") with corresponding predicates, allowing dynamic generation of filtering criteria based on user input.

Implemented operations include:

- `FindCommandParser#parse()`: Interprets the user's input and generates the appropriate predicate to filter the list of
  developers or clients.
- `Model#updateFilteredPersonList()`: Updates the list displayed in the UI based on the provided predicate.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the find mechanism behaves at each step:

**Step 1.** The user launches the application. The list of developers and clients are displayed.

**Step 2.** To filter developers by name, the user executes the command `find-developer n/ alice bob`. The application
recognizes the "developer n/" prefix and uses the `NameContainsKeywordsPredicate` to generate a filtering criteria. The
list in the UI is updated to only display developers named Alice or Bob.

**Step 3.** Next, the user wants to find clients from a specific organisation. They use the
command `find-client o/ Google`. The "find-client o/" prefix maps to the `OrganisationContainsKeywordsPredicate` and
filters clients associated with Google.

**Step 4.** If the user provides an unrecognized prefix, e.g., `find-developer z/ alice`, an error message is displayed
informing them of the correct command format.

> :information_source: **Note:** While the user can search by multiple keywords, each keyword maps to an entire word in
> the attributes. For example, searching for "Ali" will not return "Alice".

The following sequence diagram provides an overview of how the find operation is executed:

[Diagram would be inserted here illustrating the parsing of the command, identification of the appropriate predicate, and subsequent filtering of the list.]

### Design Considerations:

**Aspect:** Implementation of the predicate map:

**Alternative 1 (current choice):**

- Use a long chain of `if-else` conditions for each attribute.
    - **Pros:** Explicit parsing logic for each attribute.
    - **Cons:** Code becomes lengthy and hard to maintain. Adding a new attribute involves modifying the parsing logic,
      increasing the risk of errors.

**Alternative 2:**

- Use a map linking prefixes to their corresponding predicate constructors.
    - **Pros:** Simplifies the parsing process. Adding a new attribute to search becomes as simple as adding a new entry
      in the map.
    - **Cons:** A potential mismatch between the prefix and its predicate can lead to wrong results.

Given the benefits of a more maintainable and scalable codebase, we've decided to go with the first alternative. Future
enhancements might include fuzzy search.

### Parameter Information

Within the tables below, you can find out more about the parameters that CodeContact supports. These parameters come in
handy when crafting commands in CodeContact.

Here are some notes about these parameters.

* Each parameter comes with **constraints**. These constraints detail the specific formats of text that
  each parameter accepts as valid user input.
    * Not following these constraints will **result in an error** when entering the command.
      *Nonetheless, CodeContact will not stop working. Rather, a message will be provided to you on
      how to correct your command.
