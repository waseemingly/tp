***Taking charge of your PROject Management!***

Seamlessly integrate contact, client, and project management, simplifying access to coding-related contacts,
facilitating collaboration, and offering command-line efficiency for project managers.

CodeContact is a **desktop app for managing contacts, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still
having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, CodeContact can get your contact
management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps. **CodeContact** aims to put the **P.R.O** in project management  by enabling project managers to be:
  > **1. Productive**
  > **2. Reliable**
  > **3. Organised**

Here’s an overview of how CodeContact can help you streamline your project management processes.
* Store and edit information about developers and clients related to projects.
* Store and manage projects and their deadlines.
* Assign projects to developers and clients.

If you are familiar with CodeContact, jump to our [**Table of Contents**](#table-of-contents) to find out what you are looking
for!

If you are new here, you may start with learning [**How to navigate this guide**](#navigating-this-guide) and visit
the [**Quick Start**](#quick-start) guide to onboard onto CodeContact smoothly!

### **Parameter Information**

Within the tables below, you can find out more about the parameters that CodeContact supports. These parameters come in
handy when crafting commands in CodeContact.

Here are some notes about these parameters.

* Each parameter comes with **constraints**. These constraints detail the specific formats of text that
  each parameter accepts as valid user input.
    * Not following these constraints will **result in an error** when entering the command.
    * Nonetheless, CodeContact will not stop working. Rather, a message will be provided to you on
      how to correct your command.

    1. Text used in commands, such as `add-developer`.
    2. Keys on your keyboard like `Enter`.
    3. File names such as `CodeContact.jar`.
       <br>
<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">
:bulb: This is a blue box. It can be used for additional tips or more useful information.
</div>

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-warning">
:exclamation: This is a warning box. It can be used to give more details on the warnings and limitations of features.
</div>

#### Command Formatting

| Format                                       | Explanation                                                        | Example                            |

| Command Box                      | Allows users to enter CodeContact commands.                                                                                                                                                                |

| Tabs                             | Allows users to see different lists of information on clicking on the relevant tabs. The tabs will also automatically switch to the correct tab corresponding to the command executed.                     |
| Developers/Clients/Projects card | Displays a list of Developer, Client or Project Cards. This list can be manipulated through commands like `find` and `list`.                                                                               |
| Deadlines progress               | Displays the progress of deadlines for a certain project.                                                                                                                                                  |

| Re-sort                          | Click on the respective words, there will be a small black arrow that appears. You can press to resort the data eg. show date from furthest to nearest day.                                                |

### Notes on GUI
<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-warning">
If you executed a `find` command in developer tab and switched to the client tab, when you return to the developer tab the find results will be cleared and
the whole list of developers will be shown again. This is the intended behavior of CodeContact as we hope that this can save you the time
from always needing to call the list command.

### **Import**
> **Your lightning-fast and reliable way of porting over existing project details into CodeContact.**


#### Import developers' details : `import-developer`

> Reads a CSV file and populates the addressbook with the developers provided.

**Command Format:** `import-developer FILENAME`

**Column Header Format (for CSV file):** `Name`, `Contact Number`, `Email`, `Address`, `Date Joined`, `Role`, `Salary`, `GithubId`, `Rating`, `Projects`

**Constraints:**    
1. The CSV file has to be in the same folder as the JAR file for the command to function correctly.

2. The CSV file has to strictly follow the column header names and order (given in the example).    
   The entire command will abort if any of column headers do not follow the given format.

3. `NAME` and `PROJECT_NAME` fields for developers to be added via the import feature have the same constraints as the [`add-developer` command](#add-developer--add-developer) constraints.    
   The entire command will abort if any of the rows have invalid values that do not comply with given constraints.    

**Optional Fields:**     
While `PROJECT` and `DATE JOINED` column headers are compulsory, they are optional fields, where values (corresponding to the developer to be added) under these columns can be empty.    

If values are empty, corresponding developers will be added with `DATE JOINED` automatically set to today and/or with no projects assigned to them, like the [`add-developer` command](#add-developer--add-developer).


Example of valid CSV:

```
Name, Contact Number, Email, Address, Date Joined, Role, Salary, GithubId, Rating, Projects,,

```

**Example of usage:** `import-developer developers.csv`

Reads `developers.csv` and adds a new developer for each row of data.

When command succeeds, CLI shows:
```
New developer added: faiz;
Phone: 87654321;
Email: faiz@u.com;
Address: utown;
Date Joined: 12-12-2020;

# **FAQ**

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains
the data of your previous CodeContact home folder.


**Q**: How can I launch CodeContact if the clicking on the JAR file does not work? <br>
**A**: There are two possible methods to launch CodeContact.
<br>

* Method 1: For users familiar with the command prompt
  1. Open the command prompt.
  2. Navigate to the directory where the JAR file is located using cd [JAR file location].
  3. Type `java -jar CodeContact.jar` and press enter.
  4. CodeContact should launch.
   <br> <br>

* Method 2: For users that wish to create a script to launch CodeContact (Recommended)

  1. Create a new text file.
  2. Type the following into the text file:
   `java -jar [JAR file location]/CodeContact.jar`.
  3. Save the text file as CodeContact.bat (Windows) or CodeContact.sh (MacOS/Linux).
  4. Change the admin settings of the script to allow it to run as a program:
    * Windows: Right-click on the script and select Properties. Under General , check
      the box that says Allow this file to run as a program.
    * MacOS/Linux: Open the terminal and navigate to the directory where the script is
      located. Type `chmod +x [script name]` and press enter (`chmod +x` changes
      permissions of the script to allow it to be executed).
  5. Double-click on the script to launch CodeContact.
  6. CodeContact should launch.


**Q**: How can I check my java version?<br>

# **Known issues**
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only
   the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the
   application before running the application again.
2. **When tampering with the storage files**, if you tamper with the storage files leading to incorrect format, the application will not be able to
   read the data and will throw an error. The remedy is to delete the `addressbook.json` file created by the application before
   running the application again.
